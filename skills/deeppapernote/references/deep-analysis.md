# Deep Analysis

Language note: the analytical standard is language-independent. Draft in the configured output language; for `en`, use the exact headings and labels in `output-language.md`. Chinese-specific examples below apply only to `zh-CN`.

Use this guide when the user wants a note that feels like a real research note rather than a cleaned-up summary.

## Goal

Produce a paper note in the configured language that helps future rereading answer:
- this paper is really solving what problem
- the core route or method chain is what
- which evidence actually supports the claim
- where the paper is weak, bounded, or easy to misread
- whether it is worth follow-up, comparison, implementation, or citation

## Key Principle

Do not treat deterministic script output as the final note.

Scripts in `DeepPaperNote` are for:
- resolving the paper
- fetching metadata and PDF
- extracting evidence and PDF assets
- planning figure/table candidates
- linting and writing files

The real value comes from the model reading the available material and writing the note in its own words.

## Source Priority

Use sources in this order:

1. synthesis bundle metadata
2. evidence extracted from the full PDF
3. figure/table captions and candidate assets
4. abstract metadata only for identity and context, not as a substitute for a finished deep note

For a finished long-term note, require a usable PDF-backed evidence path.

If you only have the abstract after the supported PDF acquisition paths have failed, stop and ask for a usable PDF, OCR, or source material rather than writing a provisional or abstract-only note.

## Analysis Checklist

Use the synthesis bundle's paper-type contract and decide:
- which sections deserve the most weight
- which details need `###` subheadings
- which 3 to 6 numbers matter most
- which central claims are supported by which source sections or pages
- what each central claim actually proves and does not prove
- which negative, weak, missing, or limiting results constrain the conclusion
- which research or engineering takeaways are specific enough to reuse
- which figure/table placeholders are essential
- whether the paper needs explicit formulas, objective functions, or complexity expressions

## Writing Rules

- Write for future rereading, not for one-time display.
- Prefer interpretation over translation.
- Prefer “这篇论文真正有价值的点是...” over “本文提出了...” style filler.
- Avoid pasting long English sentences into Chinese sections.
- Do not fabricate metrics, ablations, or claims not supported by evidence.
- When an individual claim has weak evidence within an otherwise sufficient Source Corpus, narrow the wording and state the claim boundary explicitly.
- For method papers, write like a replication-minded researcher rather than a summary assistant.

## Section Guide

### 核心信息

Must include:
- title
- authors
- affiliations or institutions when available
- published date
- venue or journal when available
- DOI
- source URL
- code repo or project page when available
- domain

### 一句话总结

Do not paraphrase the abstract.

Answer:
- what the paper's real contribution is
- what the title may overstate

### 研究问题

Answer:
- the concrete pain point
- why existing methods are not enough
- whether this is a new problem, a new angle on an old problem, or a more realistic reformulation

### 数据与任务定义

Must separate:
- where the data comes from
- what labels or supervision exist
- what the actual task is
- what the paper is not predicting

For clinical or social-science papers, spell out:
- collection setting
- weak supervision risks
- annotation or rating assumptions
- whether the task is realistic or simplified

### 方法主线

This is usually where a shallow note fails.

Explain:
- the information flow
- what each stage consumes and produces
- what the model is actually doing
- what is standard versus paper-specific
- what the training target or optimization target really is
- how inference or sampling actually proceeds
- which implementation details matter for reproducing the claimed gain
- even if an extracted Algorithm block is broken, reconstruct the mechanism in plain engineering language rather than giving up
- make the reader feel the Input -> key transformation -> Output flow, not just the paper's terminology

For method, framework, or system papers:
- default to an explicit `### 机制流程` subsection inside `方法主线`
- write it as a 3 to 4 step numbered list rather than a long paragraph
- each step should say what goes in, what operation happens, and where the output goes next
- if the paper has both training and inference details, use `### 机制流程` for the dominant execution chain and leave training recipe details to neighboring subsections

For complex papers, use `###` subheadings such as:
- `### 机制流程`
- `### 数据构建`
- `### 中间表征抽取`
- `### 模型结构`
- `### 训练与推理`

### 关键结果

Do not dump all metrics.

Include:
- the most important comparison
- the most important numbers
- at least one result that looks strong
- at least one result that limits the claim

For method papers, also ask:
- does the result support the claimed mechanism
- is the gain internal-only or external too
- if the paper reports ablations or removed-module comparisons, include at least one setting that hurt performance, made training unstable, or revealed a trade-off
- if the evidence bundle contains no such negative ablation signal, say explicitly that the paper did not clearly report failed or unstable settings

### 深度分析

This is the most important part.

Include:
- research value
- practical value
- why the method may work
- where the evidence is still thin
- hidden assumptions
- what the paper does not prove

Use the plan's `central_claims` as the spine of this section:
- connect each major claim to the evidence that supports it
- say exactly what the evidence proves
- say what remains unproven, untested, or only indirectly supported
- use `mechanism_result_map` to explain why the paper's mechanism, protocol, construct, or data decision should produce the observed result pattern
- use `comparative_positioning` to say what changes relative to strong baselines or obvious alternatives, not only that the paper is better
- when the paper has Discussion or Limitations, explain the mechanism behind those caveats rather than copying them as a list

Good subsections often include:
- `### 真正贡献是什么`
- `### 为什么结果成立`
- `### 哪些地方容易被误读`
- `### 训练目标`
- `### 推理与采样链路`
- `### 复杂度与扩展性`

### 局限

Write real limitations, not polite filler.

Prefer:
- dataset or sampling boundaries
- label leakage or weak-supervision risks
- evaluation mismatch
- deployment gap
- missing baselines
- unrealistic task framing

### 我的笔记

Seed future follow-up with prompts such as:
- one reusable idea
- one questionable assumption
- one experiment worth replicating
- one related paper to compare next

## Figures And Tables

When the paper has useful visuals:
- preserve placeholders for the important ones
- prioritize one method figure, one data/task figure, and one result figure or table
- if a high-confidence pipeline or architecture figure clearly matches the core execution chain, place it in `### 机制流程` first
- explain why each figure matters
- keep original paper numbering such as `Fig. 1` or `Table 2`

Do not dump every extracted image into the note body.

## Formula Guidance

If a formula is central to understanding the method, do not leave it out just because the rest of the prose reads smoothly.

Typical cases where a formula should appear:
- probability factorization
- optimization objective
- loss definition
- complexity comparison
- scaling-law fit

Prefer a few stable, well-explained formulas over many noisy ones.
- after each retained formula, add one short engineering explanation of what it means in implementation terms
- do not stop at naming variables; explain what operation, objective term, or state update the formula corresponds to

## Minimum Honesty Standard

A finished note requires sufficient PDF-backed source coverage. Within that coverage, match each claim's strength to its evidence and state uncertainty explicitly.
